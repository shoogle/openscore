# Requiem, op. 48

This folder contains the engraving files for Gabriel Faur√©'s Requiem op. 48.

The engraving files are stored a flat XML files in order to make them suitable for git's diff mechanism.

The shell script fetch_imslp.sh is used to fetch the [1901 Edition](http://imslp.org/wiki/Requiem,_Op.48_(Faur%C3%A9,_Gabriel)#IMSLP30151), which serves as blueprint for the OpenScore edition.

## II. Offertoire

Work on this part started from the [preview score](https://musescore.com/openscore-transcriptions/scores/4494236) provided by the OpenScore project.

The file has been renamed to Faure_Requiem_op48_II_Offertoire.mscx in order to remove dots, spaces etc. from the file name and ease the handling with command line tools.
